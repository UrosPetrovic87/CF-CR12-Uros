For this CodeReview, the following criteria will be graded:

(30) make a CRUD (create/read/update/delete) for the touristic agency offers.

(20) create a details file: when you click on any offer it will lead you to a new page that will show more information about the offer that was clicked on.

(25) On the details page, you need to use google maps API to show the location of the offer (remember that your database should have the columns longitude and latitude).

(25)Use the weather forecast API available in pre-work. Remember that the key is available there for you. There should be a button in the details page that would trigger an AJAX function that will show the weather for the exact location from the offer. Remember that the longitude and latitude were stored in the DB and already used in the previous task.
